			<div id="tvss"><h1>The<br/>Ventriloquist</br>Summerschool</h1></div>
			<div id="a"><h1>Oslo,</br>Aug 8&ndash;13</h1></div>
			<div id="b">
				<p>The second edition of The Ventriloquist Summerschool will look into the role of illusion as a way of being, working and generating knowledge. How does illusion take part in the constructs we build for ourselves and for the other? What's involved in accepting, rejecting, validating and iterating such constructs and how do we use them to project and deal with what's in front and ahead of us?</p>

				<p/>This year the Ventriloquist Summerschool is taking place at the gallery 1857 in the Gr&oslash;nland area of Oslo. The whole gallery area, which is made up of a former lumberyard, will be at the disposal of the summerschool. In addition, of course, to the city itself.</p>

				<p>The summer school is open for anyone of any age, studying or working within design, the arts and all other creative fields. Applications are welcomed from all over the world &ndash; both from students and professionals. We especially encourage those with an interest in exploring the illusions of constructs to apply. Luckily, we can invite people to attend, free of charge.</p>

				<p>The date is 8&ndash;13th of August, full time. The Ventriloquist Summerschool Public Programme will include evening lectures open to the public.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div id="two" class="split split-horizontal">
			<div id="c"><p>During the week five workshops will run parallel:</p></div>
			<div id="d">
				<h2>Affirmative Poetics</h2>
				<p>We reserve the right to not be understood.</br>
					We reserve the right to establish non-centres.</br>
					We suggest new macrocosms and new origins.</br>
					We make affirmations in order to construct our cosmos, acknowledging that also parts can be a whole.</br>
				</p>
				<p>
					We ask: How do we create without linearity? What does the languages we establish say about us, and how does it say what it says?
				</p>
				<p>It is for us possible to be the same and yet to be the different.</p>
				<p>We leave room for exchange and for plurality of reading.</p>
				<p>This is a continuous exchange.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="e">
				<h2>Projection as Program+me</h2>
				<p>
					What do <i>program</i>, <i>programme</i> and <i>programming</i> have in common? Where do architecture, filmmaking, graphic design and performance meet? How can a loop take a life of its own, and what are the relevant feedback loops and structures to be constructed in order to make this living loop physical through living situations in real life? Am I being repetitive?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="f">
				<h2>Look Who&#39;s Talking Now</h2>
				<p>
					As publishers of a magazine, we are interested in how information travels. Between countries, from designer to reader, around a city metro. We are also interested in the exchange of ideas that takes place when different types of writing, imagery, culture, identity get the chance to meet in one place and hang out bit, listen to each other talk. The Ventriloquist Summer School gives us the unique opportunity to bring a world ranging group of perspectives into Oslo, and to broadcast the experience of the city from within. Our workshop will focus on understanding the networks of the city of Oslo and different ways of amplifying those findings. Our method is to make use of the quick, dumb, casual, intuitive, persistent, iterative. To make a lot and to see what sticks. To talk as fast as we think.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="g">
				<h2>A Probability of Being Seen</h2>
				<p>
					"The PLACE is neither a construction nor a destruction. It comes into being as a result of an indemnified decision. The PLACE has no sufficient reason in the world. It is in the artist that this reason subsists. It is he/she that calls for the PLACE. It is created by him/her who steps within it. It is only in the PLACE, and not outside of it, that "art is created by all". The PLACE cannot be mechanically fixecd up but it must be incessantly perpetuated."
				</p>
				<p>&mdash; From "An introduction to the general theory of PLACE" (1966) by Wies&#0322;aw Borowski, Anka Ptaszkowska and Mariusz Tchorek, founders of Foksal Gallery in Warsaw, Poland.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="h">
				<h2>Cover + Reveal</h2>
				<p>
				The Illusion of Language: In this workshop participants will explore the manipulation of found language, using Oslo as our studio and place of inspiration. If we can name something, then it can exist. How can poetry be a tool of the designer? How can we hammer out words just as we could flatten out a mangy piece of metal?</p>

			<div id="i"><p>Each of the 5 parallel workshops will be lead by the following tutors:</p></div>
